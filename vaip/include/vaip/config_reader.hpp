 * Graph engine could find xclbin without the user setting XLNX_VART_FIRMWARE.
 * But, VAIP could not determine which one is actually used. So there are a few

 * couldn't find the any config. 2 Graph engine automatically found a different
 * xclbin file which is conflicting with xclbin and config_file option.
